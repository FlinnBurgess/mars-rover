This program takes in information about an area of Mars and a number of different rovers, and tells you where on the grid each rover will end up.

## Requirements

## Usage

## Assumptions
* Multiple rovers can occupy the same grid coordinates
* A grid size input of `m n` implies a width of `m` and a height of `n`
* A grid size input of `1 1` implies that there is only a single occupiable location with coordinates `0 0`
